//! This is used as a set of common behaviors used for integration testing between the DB and Server crates.
//! Its primary purpose is to provide the `setup` and `setup_client` methods.
//! These will reset the database and populate it with a provided fixture, the values of which are then
//! allowed to be used within the scope of the test.
//!
//! This crate relies heavily on the implementation of diesel_cli for performing the database resets.
